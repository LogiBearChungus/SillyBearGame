# "Bearserkers"

Genre: Roguelike Horde-Survival
Tone: A mix of cute and brutal  think overpowered bears in armor shredding through waves of weird forest/magical enemies.
Gameplay Core: Top-down twin-stick combat (like Vampire Survivors), auto-attacks and passive weapons, timed or objective-based sessions.

Setting

A mysterious, cursed forest where nature has turned on itself. Strange magical corruption is spreading, and ancient animal spirits are being twisted into monsters. You play as one of the Ursa Guardians, powerful bear warriors from ancient tribes awakened to cleanse the land.

Gameplay Objectives

4 mission-based structure ideas to give players purpose:

1. Cleanse the Forest (Zone-Based Progression)

The game is divided into biomes/zones (e.g. Misty Pines, Fungal Marsh, Frozen Hollow).

In each zone, you must survive and cleanse the corruption source.

Each run is a 20-minute survival, but with mini-objectives every few minutes, like:

Defeat a mini-boss

Destroy corrupted altars

Escort forest spirits

Gather ritual items

At the end, a major boss appears. Beat it to unlock the next zone and new upgrades.

2. Totem Defense Mode

You're defending a sacred Forest Totem in the center of the map.

Enemies try to destroy it  you need to survive while keeping it safe.

Upgrades allow you to build defenses (vines, traps, friendly critters).

Encourages movement and tactical play beyond just surviving.

3. Spirit Rescue Missions

Each run has 3 spirit animals trapped in different parts of the map.

You must fight through hordes, rescue them, and bring them back to a central grove.

Each rescued spirit gives you a buff or passive weapon.

Rescuing all 3 and surviving unlocks permanent upgrades or lore bits.

4. Boss Hunt (Short Burst Runs)

Focused, 10-minute runs where you must:

Fight waves

Choose paths/upgrades

Reach and slay a boss creature thats corrupting the forest

Think of it like a mix between Hades (short structured runs) and VS (auto-combat).

Bear Characters (Playable Heroes)

Each bear has a unique playstyle:

Grizzlemaw  Tanky melee with earthshock powers

Frostine  Ice magic and slowing auras

Ashpaw  Fire claws, burn damage over time

Thorncub  Ranged bear cub with poisonous berries and traps

Lunaglow  Celestial bear, support/healer style
