# 🐻 Bearserkers

**Genre:** Roguelike Horde-Survival  
**Tone:** A mix of *cute and brutal* — think overpowered bears in armor shredding through waves of weird forest/magical enemies.  
**Core Gameplay:** Top-down twin-stick combat (like *Vampire Survivors*) with auto-attacks, passive weapons, and timed or objective-based sessions.

---

## 🌲 Setting

A mysterious, cursed forest where nature has turned on itself. Strange magical corruption spreads through the land, twisting ancient animal spirits into monsters.

You play as one of the **Ursa Guardians** — powerful bear warriors from ancient tribes awakened to cleanse the land.

## 🎯 Gameplay Objectives

### 1. Cleanse the Forest (Zone-Based Progression)
- The game is divided into biomes/zones (e.g. *Misty Pines*, *Fungal Marsh*, *Frozen Hollow*).
- Survive and cleanse the corruption source in each zone.
- Each run is a 20-minute survival featuring mini-objectives like:
  - Defeat a mini-boss  
  - Destroy corrupted altars  
  - Escort forest spirits  
  - Gather ritual items  
- Defeat the final zone boss to unlock the next area and new upgrades.

---

### 2. Totem Defense Mode
- Defend a sacred **Forest Totem** in the center of the map.
- Enemies attack in waves — protect the totem while surviving.
- Build defenses with upgrades (vines, traps, friendly critters).
- Encourages movement and tactical play beyond just surviving.

---

### 3. Spirit Rescue Missions
- Each run hides **three spirit animals** trapped around the map.
- Fight through hordes to rescue and return them to the central grove.
- Each rescued spirit grants a buff or passive weapon.
- Rescue all three and survive to unlock permanent upgrades and lore.

---

### 4. Boss Hunt (Short Burst Runs)
- Focused, 10-minute runs designed for quick, high-intensity play.
- Fight waves, choose paths/upgrades, and hunt a boss creature corrupting the forest.
- Inspired by *Hades* (structured runs) and *Vampire Survivors* (auto-combat).
